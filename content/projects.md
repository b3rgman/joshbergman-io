Here are some of the projects I have worked on.

# Predator Detection System
This was created as a scienxce project to deter predators from attacking animals or pets.

# Digital trading card system (In Progress)
This was created as an Innovation Project for FIRST Lego League Rototics.  The objective was to create a 3D immersive digital trading card system.  We used design boards, javascript, CSS and html to create the basis of the app.
